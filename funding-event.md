Whether it’s family and friends round to get you started, an Angel or VC round, or a bridge loan needed for short term cash flow. Know what’s best for you and what you need to be able to go get it. Raising money takes preparation and time. Knowing how you expect to raise money and the criteria you’ll need to meet, factor large in many early — and later — company decisions. Position yourself correctly and you’ll have a much easier time.
