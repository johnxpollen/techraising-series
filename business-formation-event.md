While entrepreneurs have grand visions and bold plans for success, preserving the hard-won value in your business often depends on your, or your corporate lawyer’s, ability to move things forward “three yards at a time in a cloud of dust.”  This is true whether it’s in the context of a simple consulting agreement, a single-page NDA, a bevy of financing documents or 200-pages worth of merger mumbo-jumbo.

We’ll  peer into the cloud of dust by looking at language negotiated in real-life contracts.  Join Bill Richter, of Richter Law Offices, and discover how law can be part architecture, part social engineering; part open heart surgery, part dermatology; part rough and tumble, part smooth sailing. It all depends on what you’ve got and what you bring to the game.

Send a redacted version of a section of agreements you never understood or never liked, or loved and hit a home run with to [techraising@gmail.com] in advance and and see where the dust falls. Or come and learn from what others are dealing with.
