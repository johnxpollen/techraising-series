While entrepreneurs have grand visions and bold plans for success, preserving the hard-won value in
your business often depends on your, or your corporate lawyer’s, ability to move things forward
“three yards at a time in a cloud of dust.” Getting started the right way not only saves you headaches,
it saves you money and increases the value of your company. Fixing mistakes are costly and if you ever
want to raise money, investors will use these types of mistakes to negotiate down value. The right
business structure will make it easier for you to attract quality talent, partners and must be done
before you can get funded.
