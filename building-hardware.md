“Hardware is hard.” When building a hardware business, the margin for error is slim. A minor design
change has the ability to delay a launch by months, and cost tens – if not hundreds – of thousands
of dollars. Product market fit is essential. Pricing and financial modeling must be accurate. Supply
chain, execution, and timing are critical. Come get the lowdown on how to build a budget, schedule,
and pitch for a hardware company, and learn about common pitfalls to avoid.
