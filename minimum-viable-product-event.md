## Tuesday April 23rd @ 6:00-8:00pm. Cruzio

The first release of a product is crucial. Including things that aren’t needed bloat your product,
consume time and money, and create friction. Including too little and it doesn’t satisfy your
customer. Learn how to tell between the two and build a product that users will love and talk about,
and that can be built on as the business progresses.

Topics covered during the 45 minute presentation:

- Efficient, argument-proof way to prioritize features
- Good vs Fast vs Cheap
- Mobile vs Desktop vs Web
- Hiring & managing virtual team vs local talent
- Software has a half-life

Questions you can ask during subsequent 45 minutes of Q&A:

- Example: How much should I expect to pay for MVP product that does X
- Example: Should I hire locally or remotely?
- Example: What do I do after my MVP is launched?
- Example: I have an MVP that has languished for a year with no traction. Now what?
- In short, bring your problems and let's find solutions
