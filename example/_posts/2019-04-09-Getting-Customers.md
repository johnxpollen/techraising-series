## Getting Customers

#### Get your first customer or improve current methods.

Getting your first customer is one of the biggest challenges a company faces. And itâ€™s not just any customer, you want the right customers because interaction with customers affect decisions you make about your products and services. You need to be able to get the customers you are looking to serve so your mission, vision and goals as a company are  aligned with the wants, needs, and aspirations of you customers. We no longer sell customers, we enable them to buy. Learn who your customer is, how to reach and interact with them, and how to enable them to buy.
